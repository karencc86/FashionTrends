🌱🌿 Sustainable Fashion: Eco-Friendly Trends (2010 – 2024)
This project uses a quantitative and exploratory approach to analyze the dataset called “ms,” which contains information on different aspects of sustainable fashion from 2010  to 2024.

📚 CONTEXT
This dataset was taken from the Kaggle database to perform exploratory data analysis and analyze the socio-environmental impact of the fashion industry in terms of sustainability.

🛠️ LIBRARIES
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

📈 OBJECTIVES
❖ General objective
-To analyze current trends in sustainable fashion in the period 2010-2024, focusing on the ecological practices adopted by the industry to reduce its environmental impact.

❖ Specific objectives
-Identify the most commonly used eco-friendly materials and sustainable technologies in fashion production, such as recycled, organic, or low environmental impact fabrics.
-Analyze the variability and distribution of carbon footprints in different countries to identify patterns of environmental impact by region.
-Evaluate the relationship between countries, sustainable certifications, and the implementation of recycling programs to determine which regions are leading the way in eco-friendly initiatives.

📊 FINDINGS
❖ Low correlation between numerical environmental variables: the correlation matrix shows that numerical variables such as water use, carbon footprint, waste production, and average price are not strongly correlated with each other. This suggests that each of these variables behaves independently within the context of sustainable fashion, and there is no clear linear relationship between them.
❖Price differences between sustainable and non-sustainable materials: The violin chart shows that the average prices of sustainable materials vary significantly compared to non-sustainable materials; some materials such as organic cotton and recycled polyester show higher prices in eco-friendly products.
❖Market trends for different materials: The bar chart shows that some materials, such as organic cotton and bamboo, are mostly on an upward trend, while others, such as vegan leather, are stable; this suggests that certain eco-friendly materials are gaining popularity in the market.

🧐☝🏼️ SUGGESTIONS
❖Promoting the use of materials that are widely accepted in the market, such as organic cotton and bamboo, which are experiencing strong growth, should be a priority for sustainable fashion companies. It is recommended that more product lines be developed using these materials in order to align with market preferences.

❖Adjust pricing policy according to the type of material; given that sustainable products tend to have higher prices, it is important to conduct a competitive pricing study and offer more affordable options to increase the reach of eco-friendly products among consumers.

❖Optimize the use of natural resources in production; although there is no strong correlation between environmental impact variables, it is recommended that companies implement programs to reduce water consumption and waste production, as these are key indicators of sustainability that can be optimized in manufacturing processes.
